		.."Mods are sandboxed so that they cannot harm the user. At most, they can break the game and mess up your savegames. "
		.."That is a good thing! "
		.."As far as I can tell, there is no way to mod the game's window layout, which generally makes sense. "
		.."Therefore, there are only two ways for the game to get a nice fullscreen mode:"
		.."\n[olist]"
		.."\n[*]The game gets patched, either by the original devs or by the type of modder that brought us JA2 1.13"
		.."\n[*]An external tool, which this provides"
			.."\n[list]"
			.."\n[*]This does include the source"
			.."\n[/list]"
		.."\n[/olist]"
	.."\n[*][b]If used while the game is in its own fullscreen mode, strange things may happen, so just don't[/b]"
	.."\n[*]"
		.."The way this works, it cannot force the JA3 output to scale, "
		.."so if your machine cannot handle fullscreen resolution, "
		.."you will get a black backdrop. No idea if and how this can be fixed, sorry"
	.."\n[*]In rare cases, switching from and to JA3 a lot may make the tool lose track"
	.."\n[*]"
		.."When switching out of the game and switching back in, there will shortly be a title bar â€“ "
		.."this is due to the game's behavior and I have not found a way to prevent that, "
		.."but it does no harm to the game"
	.."\n[*]Works for primary screen only"
	.."\n[/list]"
	.."\n[hr][/hr]"
	.."\n[b]NOTE[/b]"
		.."Technically, JA3's fullscreen is a borderless window, but unfortunately, it behaves somewhat like the old exclusive fullscreen. "
		.."Therefore, I reject the game's fullscreen setting. "
		.."If you have issues with the game's own fullscreen mode as I have, this is for you. You're welcome."
